# Advance-Operating-System
This is our project names "Patient Monitoring System.  As we all know that the world is going through a very tough time. Covid-19 has done a lot of damage in our daily life. This virus is very contagious. That’s why it spread very fast. It spread form an affected person to another person. This virus attacks our lunge. That’s why the blood oxygen level gets down. So, we decided to build a Blood oxygen measurement device. Which is IOT based. So that the doctor can check the patient’s oxygen level and BPM without touching the person. For this feature we use Blynk application. This app will show the result through internet network.
